                <p>Lake Toba is an immense volcanic lake covering an area of 1,707 km² (1,000 km² bigger than Singapore) with an island in its centre. Actually, Lake Toba is located in Prapat area in North Sumatra.</p>
                <p>Formed by a gigantic volcanic eruption some 70,000 years ago, it is probably the largest resurgent caldera on Earth. Some studies say it might have been associated with causing previous ice age/climate change and the largest human population bottleneck ever. Genetic estimates suggests that there were only a few thousand individuals that survived its catastrophic eruption.</p>
                <p>Today Lake Toba is on the way to get a UNESCO Geopark Certification. This means, that the whole area has to be protected and a Ecotourism has will be developed. But still some big environment destroying international companies like Aquafarms and pulp industries are operating. The President himself installed now an Authority (BODT) to develop a sustainable Tourism around Lake Toba. Lake Toba apply for a credit of the Wolrd Bank to create the Geopark.</p>
                <p>The island in the middle - Pulau Samosir - was joined to the caldera wall by a narrow isthmus, which was cut through to enable boats to pass; a road bridge crosses the cutting. Samosir island is the cultural centre of the Batak tribe who are now mostly Christians. The Batak Culture has a lot of Rituals and Parties. You can visit them also, eat there and by the dancing you can contribute then with some money for the wedding or the funeral.</p>
                <p>Lake Toba was perhaps once more popular than it is nowadays, but for many it remains a firm fixture on the Banana Pancake Trail. Tuktuk is a great laid back place to chill out for a few days after jungle trekking etc. The location is very popular with Chinese tourists around Chinese New Year, when availability drops dramatically and accommodation costs sky rocket.</p>
                <p>And Lake Toba has much more than only Tuktuk. The Lake Toba Area is divided in seven Regencies (Kapupaten): -Karo in the north with Berastagi and the Volcanoes Sinabung and Sibayak -Simalungun with Sipisopiso Waterfall and Parapat -Toba Samosir with Balige, Laguboti -Tapanuli Utara with the International Airport Silangit, Tarutung with the hot springs, Muara and Sipadan island -Humbang Hasundutan with the Bakkara Valley, the Sipangnolu Spring, the kings house of Sisingamangaraja XII, the famous coffee area of Linton, -Samosir with Tuktuk, Pangururan with the hotsprings, Sianjur Mula Mula valley and the View point Tele -Dairy with a lot of primary jungle around Merek and the 5 star Resort, and the cofee area of Sidikalang.</p>

                <h2>Bali</h2>

                <p>Bali is one of more than 17,000 islands in the Indonesian archipelago and is located just over 2  kilometers (almost 1.5 miles) from the eastern tip of the island of Java and west of the island of Lombok. The island, home to about 4 million people, is approximately 144 kilometres (90 mi.) from east to west and 80 kilometres (50 mi.) north to south.</p>
                <p>The word "paradise" is used a lot in Bali and not without reason. The combination of friendly, hospitable people, a magnificently visual culture infused with spirituality and (not least) spectacular beaches with great surfing and diving have made Bali Indonesia's unrivaled number one tourist attraction. Eighty percent of international visitors to Indonesia visit Bali and Bali alone.</p>
                <p>The popularity is not without its flip side— like many places in the island's South, once paradisiacal Kuta has degenerated into a congested warren of concrete with touts and scammers extracting a living by overcharging tourists. The island's visibility has also drawn the unwanted attention of terrorists in 2002 and 2005; however, Bali has managed to retain its magic. Bali is a wonderful destination with something for everyone, and though heavily traveled, it is still easy to find some peace and quiet if you like. Avoid the South of the island if you want a more traditional and genuine Balinese experience.</p>
                <p>A consideration is the tourist season and Bali can get very crowded in August and September and again at Christmas and New Year. Australians also visit during school holidays in early April, late June, and late September, while domestic tourists from elsewhere in Indonesia visit during national holidays. Outside these peak seasons, Bali can be surprisingly quiet and good discounts on accommodation are often available.</p>
                <p>The modest dress is expected in Bali. Although bikinis are fine on the beaches and in hotel swimming pools, they are not appropriate while shopping, eating in restaurants.</p>
